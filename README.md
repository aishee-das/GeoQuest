# GeoQuest Adventure Map

GeoQuest is a gamified travel experience that encourages users to explore various locations by completing "quests." Users can earn points, unlock virtual badges, and track their progress, making travel both interactive and rewarding.

## Features

- **Quests & Challenges:** Discover new places and complete quests such as trying local foods, visiting landmarks, or engaging with locals.
- **Category Filtering:** Filter quests by categories like Food & Drink, Landmarks, Nightlife, and more to personalise your adventure.
- **User Progress Tracking:** Keep track of completed quests and earn points and achievements.
- **Account Management:** Securely register and log in to save and manage your quests and progress.
